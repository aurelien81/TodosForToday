# ToDos for ToDay

ToDos for ToDay is a very simple todo-app that runs in the browser. It focuses on a single day's work by only allowing one active todo list. In addition, it includes a "supporters' function where the user can choose a supporter in a list, and once selected, the supporter will pop-up every once in a while to cheer the user on.

This app was developed in Javascript, html and css, without the use of any libraries. It was created as part of my coding study. It is probably full of flaws, and that is the main reason for this publication, so that better coders than me can point out the flaws.

Don't hesitate to **open discussions on this repository** if you have any comments.

## How to use this app

Since there is no currently deployed version of this project, the best way to use it is to clone the repository on your computer and open the index.html file in your browser, or through your code editor live server.

## Features

- Todo list for a day, recommended for (but not limited to) 5 tasks a day.
- 4 different themes.
- 5 different supporters that pop-up upon task completion and for alerts when necessary.
- Markdown export: export your task in markdown format to save them to your prefered markdown app. Tasks are copied to your clipboard so that they can be pasted easily.
- TODO/DONE export: similar to markdown export, but in a format that will work for [Logseq](https://logseq.com/).
- Saving all settings (themes, export, supporter, and tasks) to the browser's local storage.

## Future objectives

The goal is to release this app online as well as a desktop app. There is no timeline as to when this will happen for now.
